# PRODIGY_CS_01
This program allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages by shifting letters based on a given key. It was a great way to deepen my understanding of cryptography, string manipulation, and Python programming.

Hereâ€™s what my project does:
1. Takes user input for a message and shift value
2. Encrypts the text by shifting letters forward
3. Decrypts the text by shifting letters backward
4. Preserves uppercase, lowercase, and non-alphabet characters
